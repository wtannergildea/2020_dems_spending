# How have 2020 Dems spent their money?

Using FEC disbursement reports from Jan 1 - Jun 30 2019, I analyze how the top Democratic candidates for president have spent their money. 

Here is the [FEC data source](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?data_type=processed&committee_id=C00693234&committee_id=C00694455&committee_id=C00695510&committee_id=C00696948&committee_id=C00697441&two_year_transaction_period=2020&min_date=01%2F01%2F2019&max_date=12%2F31%2F2020).
